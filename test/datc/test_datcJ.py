            Check how program reacts when someone orders too disbands.
            France has to disband one and has an army in Paris and Picardy.
            France: Remove F Gulf of Lyon
            France: Remove A Picardy
            France: Remove A Paris
            Program should not disband both Paris and Picardy, but should handle it in a different way. See also
            issue 4.D.6. I prefer that the disband orders are handled one by one. According to the preference, the
            removal of the fleet in the Gulf of Lyon fails (no fleet), the removal of the army in Picardy succeeds and
            the removal of the army in Paris fails (too many disbands).
