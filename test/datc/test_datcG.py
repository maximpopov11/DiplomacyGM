            Russia: F Barents Sea Supports A Sweden - Norway
            See issue 4.A.2 and 4.A.3.
            If for issue 4.A.3, choice b, c or e has been taken, then the move from Sweden to Norway is not a
            convoy and the English fleet in Norway is dislodged and the fleet in Skagerrak will not be dislodged.
            If choice a or d (1982/2000 rule) has been taken for issue 4.A.3, then the move from Sweden to Norway
            must be treated as a convoy. At that moment the situation becomes paradoxical. When the 'All Hold' rule is
            used, both the army in Sweden as the fleet in the North Sea will not advance. In all other paradox rules
            the English fleet in the North Sea will dislodge the Russian fleet in Skagerrak and the army in Sweden will
            not advance.
            I prefer the 1982 rule with the 2000 rulebook clarification concerning the convoy to adjacent places and
            I prefer the Szykman rule for paradox resolving. That means that according to these preferences the fleet
            in the North Sea will dislodge the Russian fleet in Skagerrak and the army in Sweden will not advance.

            If a unit is attacked by a supported unit, it is not possible to prevent dislodgement by trying to cut
            the support. But what, if a move is attempted via a convoy?
            Austria: F Adriatic Sea Convoys A Trieste - Venice
            Austria: A Trieste - Venice via Convoy
            Italy: A Venice Supports F Albania - Trieste
            Italy: F Albania - Trieste
            First it should be mentioned that if for issue 4.A.3 choice b or c is taken, then the move from Trieste
            to Venice is just a move over land, because the army in Venice is not moving in opposite direction. In that
            case, the support of Venice will not be cut as normal.
            In any other choice for issue 4.A.3, it should be decided whether the Austrian attack is considered to be
            coming from Trieste or from the Adriatic Sea. If it comes from Trieste, the support in Venice is not cut
            and the army in Trieste is dislodged by the fleet in Albania. If the Austrian attack is considered to be
            coming from the Adriatic Sea, then the support is cut and the army in Trieste will not be dislodged. See
            also issue 4.A.4. First of all, I prefer the 1982/2000 rules for adjacent convoying. This means that I
            prefer the move from Trieste uses the convoy. Furthermore, I think that the two Italian units are still
            stronger than the army in Trieste. Therefore, I prefer that the support in Venice is not cut and that the
            army in Trieste is dislodged by the fleet in Albania.
