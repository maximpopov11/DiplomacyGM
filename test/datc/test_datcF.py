            If the 1971 rule is used about multi-route convoys (when one of the routes is disrupted, the convoy fails),
            the Italian convoy order in the Ionian Sea is not part of the convoy, because it is a foreign unit
            (according to the DPTG).
            That means that the fleet in the Ionian Sea is not a 'convoying' fleet. In all rulings the support of
            Naples on the Ionian Sea is cut and the fleet in the Ionian Sea is dislodged by the Turkish fleet in the
            Eastern Mediterranean. When the 1982 rule is used about multi-route convoy disruption, then convoys are
            disrupted when all routes are disrupted (this is the rule I prefer). With this rule, the situation becomes
            paradoxical. According to the 1971 and 1982 paradox rules, the support given by the fleet in Naples is not
            cut, that means that the fleet in the Ionian Sea is not dislodged.
            According to the 2000 ruling the fleet in the Ionian Sea is not "necessary" and the support of Naples is
            cut and the fleet in the Ionian Sea is dislodged by the Turkish fleet in the Eastern Mediterranean.
            If the Szykman rule, the 'All Hold' rule or DPTG is used, then there is no paradoxical situation. The
            support of Naples is cut and the fleet in the Ionian Sea is dislodged by the Turkish fleet in the Eastern
            Mediterranean. As you can see, the 1982 rules allows the Italian player to save its fleet in the Ionian Sea
            with a trick. I do not consider this trick as normal tactical play. I prefer the Szykman rule as one of the
            rules that does not allow this trick. According to this rule the fleet in the Ionian Sea is dislodged.

            In all rulings, except the 1982 paradox ruling, the support of the fleet in Clyde on the North Atlantic
            Ocean is cut and the French fleet in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean will dislodge the fleet in the North Atlantic

            fleet in Clyde is not cut. That means that the English fleet in the North Atlantic Ocean is not dislodged.
            As you can see, the 1982 rule allows England to save its fleet in the North Atlantic Ocean in a very
            strange way. Just the support of Clyde is insufficient (if there is no convoy, the support is cut). Only
            the convoy to the area occupied by own unit, can do the trick in this situation. The embarking of troops
            in the fleet deceives the enemy so much that it works as a magic cloak. The enemy is not able to dislodge
            the fleet in the North Atlantic Ocean any more. Of course, this will only work in comedies. I prefer the
            Szykman rule as one of the rules that does not allow this trick. According to this rule (and all other

            resolution is that the supports of the English fleet in London the German fleet in Picardy are cut. In that
            case the French fleet in the English Channel and the Russian fleet in the North Sea will survive and will

            dislodges the fleet in the North Sea.
            The DPTG rule has in this case the same result as the Szykman rule, because the failing of all convoys is a

        """ 6.F.23. TEST CASE, SECOND ORDER PARADOX WITH TWO EXCLUSIVE CONVOYS
            In this paradox there are two consistent resolutions, but where the two convoys do not fail or succeed at
            the same time. This fact is important for the DPTG resolution.
            England: F Edinburgh - North Sea
            England: F Yorkshire Supports F Edinburgh - North Sea
            France: A Brest - London
            France: F English Channel Convoys A Brest - London
            Germany: F Belgium Supports F English Channel
            Germany: F London Supports F North Sea
            Italy: F Mid-Atlantic Ocean - English Channel
            Italy: F Irish Sea Supports F Mid-Atlantic Ocean - English Channel
            Russia: A Norway - Belgium
            Russia: F North Sea Convoys A Norway - Belgium
            Without any paradox rule, there are two consistent resolutions. In one resolution, the convoy in the
            English Channel is dislodged by the fleet in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean, while the convoy in the North Sea
            succeeds. In the other resolution, it is the other way around. The convoy in the North Sea is dislodged by
            the fleet in Edinburgh, while the convoy in the English Channel succeeds.
            The 1971 paradox rule and the 2000 rule (see issue 4.A.2) do not have an answer on this.
            According to the 1982 rule, the supports are not cut which means that the none of the units move.
            The Szykman (which I prefer), has the same result as the 1982 rule. The convoying armies fail to move and
            the supports are not cut. Because of the failure to cut the support, no fleet succeeds to move.
            When the 'All Hold' rule is used, the movement of the armies and the fleets all fail.
            Since there is no consistent resolution where all convoys fail, the DPTG rule has the same result as the
            'All Hold' rule. That means the movement of all units fail.

            When no paradox rule is used, there is no consistent resolution. If the French support in Belgium is cut,
            the French fleet in the English Channel will be dislodged. That means that the support of London will not
            be cut and the fleet in Edinburgh will dislodge the Russian fleet in the North Sea. In this way the support
            in Belgium is not cut! But if the support in Belgium is not cut, the Russian fleet in the North Sea will
            not be dislodged and the army in Norway can cut the support in Belgium.
            The 1971 paradox rule and the 2000 rule (see issue 4.A.2) do not have an answer on this. According to the
            1982 rule, the supports are not cut which means that the French fleet in the English Channel will survive
            and but the Russian fleet in the North Sea is dislodged.
            If the Szykman alternative is used (which I prefer), the supports are not cut and the convoying armies fail
            to move, which has the same result as the 1982 rule in this case.
            When the 'All Hold' rule is used, the movement of the armies in Brest and Norway as the fleets in Edinburgh
            and the Irish Sea will fail. Since there is no consistent resolution where all convoys fail, the DPTG has
            in this case the same result as the 'All Hold' rule.
